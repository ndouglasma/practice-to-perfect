# README

Practice makes perfect, and with the Practice to Perfect app, you can get the necessary practice to crush all your interviews.  Practice to Perfect gives you access to a database of interview question types (behavioral, problem-solving, motivational, technical/skills-based, and informational) and transcribes your audio answers to text for you to review.
